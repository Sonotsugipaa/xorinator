# Xorinator

## Information

Xorinator is a command-line utility for encrypting and decrypting files using the one-time pad technique. More specifically, it allows files to be "split" into multiple one-time pad files (hereinafter "*OTPs*"), then put the pieces back together.

Generally, the one-time pad technique involves using a randomly generated key (the OTP) that is as big as the message. With Xorinator, multiple OTPs can be used, at the expense of a much higher overhead in total space used: for example, splitting (hereinafter "multiplexing") one 8kb file into 5 will result in (8 Ã— 5 = 40)kb being used, potentially distributed over 5 different storage devices.

## License

Xorinator uses the [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/) (for the foreseeable future), a copy of which is included in the repository (and pasted at the beginning of multiple source files).

## Building and installing

Xorinator only depends on the C++ STL; it is meant to be compiled and linked using the GNU toolchain (+ CMake), although it has been partially tested with MSVC (with a bit of tinkering).

### On GNU/Linux systems

Use this command in the project's root directory in order to build it:

```bash
./build.sh Release
```

The executable file is `build-Release/cli-tool/xor`. In order to install it, either copy/move it to `/usr/local/bin/` or run the following command to let CMake decide the install directory:

```bash
cmake --install build-Release
```

#### On Arch Linux (and derivates)

Xorinator has an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xorinator/). In order to install it:
- Clone the AUR repository
  - `git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/xorinator.git`
- Enter the repository and build the package (the `core-devel` package group is required)
  - `cd xorinator && makepkg`
- Manually install the package
  - `pacman -U xorinator-*.pkg.tar.zst`

Alternatively, use the following one-liner:  
`(git clone 'https://aur.archlinux.org/xorinator.git' && cd xorinator && makepkg -i)`

## Usage

Xorinator provides a command-line tool as an executable file, `xor` (or `xor.exe`, for NT-based systems).

The syntax of the command expects:

1. a subcommand, either "`multiplex`" ("`mux`", "`m`") or "`demultiplex`" ("`demux`", "`dmx`", "`d`");
2. options, as described below;
3. one file path, which points to the source (for multiplexing) or to the destination (for demultiplexing);
4. one or more file paths, which point to the destination files (for multiplexing) or the sources (for demultiplexing).

Notably, using "`-`" as a file name will read or write to the standard input/output, depending on the context. Running `xor`, `xor ?` or `xor help` will print a description of the syntax.

### Options

Multiple options can be used anywhere in the argument list, unless the `--` argument is present anywhere - in which case all the arguments after it will not be interpreted as options.  
The option syntax partially follows the POSIX convention:
- unary short options may be conflated into a single argument (e.g. "`-abc`" instead of "`-a -b -c`");
- binary short options may have their values directly after the second character (e.g. "`-kPassphrase`" instead of "`-k Passphrase`");
- binary long options may have their key and value in the same argument, with a "`=`" separating the two (e.g. "`--litter=4096`" instead of "`--litter 4096`").

#### `--key PASSPHRASE`

**This option is unsafe and deprecated, and will be removed in the future.**

Each `--key` option will add a passphrase to the (de)multiplexing operation: from this passphrase `xor` generates a (cryptographically weak) hash, which will be used as a seed to generate an additional OTP.

**Note: relying on passphrases as a security measure is discouraged,
since Xorinator is meant to be used as a generator for OTPs.
Passphrase-generated OTPs are not real OTPs, since they offer less information entropy.**

#### `--quiet`

Suppress error messages that may result from incorrect input (e.g. `xor mux -`) or from runtime errors (e.g. upon opening an unreadable file).

#### `--force`

Skip platform-dependent permission checks.

A possible use case on a Linux system is when the root user attempts to write to a file, owned by said user but having permission mode `0000`: the system does not actually prevent the root user from writing to it, but the file metadata *hints* that the file should not be written to.

Using the `--force` option does not grant access to files owned by other users on any system.

#### `--litter NUM`

When performing multiplexing operations, the "`--litter NUM`" option causes up to `NUM` additional random characters to be written at the end of each output file (except one).

This is useful to hide the fact that all one-time pads have the same size as the original message.  
After a demultiplexing operation, the reconstructed message will be as big as the smallest input.

### Examples

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Symmetric key encription and decryption (suboptimal):
# the file "secret.txt" is encrypted to "secret.xor",
# then it is decrypted and printed onto the terminal.
# BEWARE - doing this defeats the purpose of Xorinator:
# the "--key" option generates a cryptographically weak hash
# from which to pseudorandomly generate a OTP.
xor mux --key=hunter2 secret.txt secret.xor
xor dmx --key=hunter2 - secret.xor

# 3-file multiplexing, without passphrase:
# the "xor" command reads arbitrary text from the standard
# input, then encrypts it onto "secret.1.xor",
# "secret.2.xor" and "secret.3.xor".
# In order to rebuild the input, the 3 generated files
# need to be demultiplexed.
xor mux - secret.1.xor secret.2.xor secret.3.xor
xor dmx secret.decrypted.txt secret.*.xor
```
